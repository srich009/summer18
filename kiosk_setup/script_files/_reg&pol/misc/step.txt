possible steps for launch vbs on start

1. Create a new user account

2. Setup the vbs script

3. Login as the new user

4. Run regedit

5. Add a new string value named Shell to "HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"
   with a value of the command that you need to run to execute your script "wscript C:\dir\script.vbs"

Different Shells for Different Users

The registry for each user account and administrator account can be set up to start a user-specific shell.
There are three keys that must be set up. The first two are generic for all users.
This article refers to the keys as "Key1," "Key2," and "Key3" for simplicity.

Key1 is a string value. When Windows XP starts, Key1 is called and the default Windows shell is started.
However, if the default value is changed to USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
Windows looks in the HKEY_Current_User key to start a specific shell for the user logging on.
If the specific user shell is not found, Key2 is called and a default shell is started.

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot\Shell

Type: REG_SZ

Value: SYS:Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

Key2 provides a default shell if the user shell application cannot be found.
When you select a shell component for a Microsoft Windows XP Embedded configuration
Key 2 is set up to the shell application as the default shell.

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell

Type: REG_SZ

Value: Explorer.exe (or this can be a different default application)

Key3 sets up a shell for the current user or logged-on user.
Thus, the only way to change a particular user's shell is to log on to the user account and create this registry entry.

Key: HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell

Type: REG_SZ

Value: **c:\windows\system32\**account shell.exe, where account shell.exe is the name of the application


When the user logs on, Windows uses Key1 to determine which key holds the shell information. Normally, Windows uses Key2 next. 
However, if the value of Key1 is changed to USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon,
Windows will use Key3 for the user logging on to start the user's specific shell.


Setting Up Key1
You must set up Key1. In the Extra Registry Data, found at the top of the configuration, add Key1 as described earlier,
with the value set for USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon.
To see the Extra Registry Data resource, you may have to enable resources by clicking View,
pointing at Resources, and then clicking Target Designer.

Setting Up Key3
To set up the user account with the unique shell, you must log on to the user account and add Key3 to set the path to the system application. 
Note that you cannot log on to the administrator account to change the user account's shell. 
After you log on to the user account, you can use Regedit.exe, Windows Script, or another application
to create Key3 and set the path to the application.


If you decide to use a Windows Script Engine, you must modify the registry data for 
the Windows Script Engine component for the Microsoft Visual Basic® Scripting Edition (VBScript) file. 
Change HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VBSFile\Shell\Open\Command and add %1 to the end of the value %11%\WScript.exe
