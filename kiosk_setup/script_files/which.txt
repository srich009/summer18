the working options for kiosk loop
----------------------------------------

CMD
  * simple kiosk 1
    (kioskbootstrap.bat & kioskstart.bat)

  * simple kiosk 2
    (test3.bat)

PS
  * simple kiosk 3
    (test_chrome2.ps1)

  * kiosk parameterized through and xml file
    (loop_kiosk_v2.ps1 & settings.xml )

  * fancy kiosk
    (msg_xml_cache.ps1 & settings.xml)

VBS
  * kiosk pops up a message when closed
    (vb_test2.vbs)

----------------------------------------

Note:
There are 2 options whne setting a login script, one is for .bat & .vbs files and one is for .ps1 files.
So far the .vbs and.bat files work fine for the login but the powershell ones dont always work right.


currently we have establised multiple solutions for the kiosk application
now the main focus is on 3 new things for scripts:
1. the automation of making the group policy object
2. possibly not needing the loop application by configuring regisrty keys for user shell
3. clearing the google chrome cache

not working...

so far the setup through regedit and group policy config automation have failed
have to be careful with registry keys, and the reg scripts have to be run on the user's account who is the kiosk.
