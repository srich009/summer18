Scripts for kiosk
-----------------

the scripts are the dynamic part which focuses or running the application.
the group policies are the static part which enforces security in the background.

these are fairly simple scripts written either as .bat file or .ps1 file.
the basic structure is an infinite loop in which a chrome kiosk window is opened.
these scripts optionally can have advanced features like being parameterized through a .xml file.

example Batch file
----------------------------------------
@echo off

:: variables
set prgm="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
set dest="https://chassintranet.ucr.edu/saas2/advisor"

:: kill explorer
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe

:: Run browser in kiosk mode infinite loop
:launch
%prgm% %dest% -kiosk 
goto launch
----------------------------------------

example Powershell script
----------------------------------------
# vars
$prgm = "chrome.exe"
$dest = "https://chassintranet.ucr.edu/saas2/advisor -kiosk"

# kill explorer
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe

# main
while(1)
{
    Start-Process $prgm -ArgumentList $dest -Wait -WindowStyle Minimized
}
----------------------------------------

these scripts combined with group policies can accomplish the task.

killing explorer.exe hides PC interface, useful for the scripts to do before entering loop. 
then the user should not be able to use the start button or taskbar at all.
the taskkill module is supported in both Command Prompt and PowerShell.
use "taskkill /f /im explorer.exe"

group policies must be set up correctly or users can access stuff they should not be able to.

example:
when explorer.exe is killed and can no longer access anything
then Ctrl + Alt + Del to get to Task Manager
then right click on an app or background process -> open file location
then when window pops up click on address bar at the top and enter "explorer.exe"
However, this does not work if some settings are disabled, so must remove the users access to these features
