script notes for app:

killing explorer.exe hides PC interface, useful for the scripts to do before entering loop. 
the taskkill module is supported in both Command Prompt and PowerShell
use: "taskkill /f /im explorer.exe"

 
solution for when explorer.exe is killed and can no longer access anything
but does not work if some settings are disabled ... eg: must remove the users access to these features
when explorer.exe is killed
then Ctrl + Alt + Del to get to Task Manager
then right click on an app or background process -> open file location
then when window pops up click on address bar at the top and enter "explorer.exe"
