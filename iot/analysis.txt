Attack Specifics:

Network Packet Based Attacks
  Specially crafted network packets can cause
	an os command injection
	the device to execute arbitrary code
	the product to run an attacker supplied shell script
	the device to overwrite sensitive files - arbitrary code execution
	unsigned firmware to be installed in the device - arbitrary code execution.
	the product to dump strings from an internal database into an HTTP response
    a remotely started SSH server on the device - persistent backdoor
    a valid authentication token to be returned to the attacker - authentication bypass
  To accomplish this an attacker might choose to
    send a series of packets
	intercept and alter network traffic
	send an HTTP request
	impersonate a remote server
	gain network connectivity to the Internet
	send an API call to enable the SSH server

Target Specifics:

(coffee maker)

When a connected coffee machine is turned on it opens a non-encrypted hotspot and listens to UPNP traffic. 
On the client side, the smartphone running the mobile app provided by the vendor of the coffee machines connects to the hotspot and sends a broadcast UDP request searching for UPNP devices. 
The Coffee machine establish the communication with the app exchanging several data including the SSID and the password to the home wireless network, unfortunately they are in clear text.
 a device, it responds to this request. After that a short communication containing the SSID and the password to the home wireless network, among other things, is sent from the smartphone to the device.
â€œThis is where we detected a problem. Although the password is sent in encrypted form, the components of the encryption key are sent through an open, non-protected channel. 

(hub)

The SmartThings Hub is a central controller that monitors and manages various internet-of-things (IoT) devices such as smart plugs, LED light bulbs, thermostats, cameras, and more that would 
typically be deployed in a smart home. The SmartThings Hub functions as a centralized controller for these devices and allows users to remotely connect to and manage these devices using a smartphone. 
The firmware running on the SmartThings Hub is Linux-based and allows for communications with IoT devices using a variety of different technologies such as Ethernet, Zigbee, Z-Wave and Bluetooth. 

(common)

Vulnerabilities common among IoT devices include unprotected USB ports, lack of digitally signed software updates and unencrypted storage of passwords for users' home Wi-Fi networks. 
Many devices come with default administrative passwords, but without warnings that users need to change those passwords. Other devices have hard-coded administrative passwords that can't be changed.
