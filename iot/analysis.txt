----------------------------------------

Threats to users:

Privacy
  rigorously anonymized data can sometimes be de-anonymized when there are other overlapping data sets available. 
  an increasing number of connected IoT devices surround us generating contextual data streams, expectation of privacy is in danger.

Data Espionage
  spying on IoT data streams directly, or at a higher level discovering control schemes, underlying architectures and deployments
  exploit metadata to deduce operating policies, internal groupings and key sets of "things," identifying events, and other intelligence without necessarily needing to break data-level encryption.

denial-of-service
  flood communications, reroute protocols, block data streams, overwhelm gateways, insert undue network latencies and even physically damage devices

Corrupting data integrity
  attempt to edit, insert or delete the data streams collected from edge devices, connected things could be first physically compromised and then used to feed back fraudulent data.

Hijacking devices
  IoT botnets, actual theft, control of devices, or the more subtle borrowing of an IoT segment to conduct some kind of harassment, demand ransom or possibly even commit violent physical acts

Suggested IoT Security:

Securing IoT devices and the networks they connect to can be challenging due to the variety of devices and vendors, and the difficulty of adding security to resource-constrained devices.
There are many protocols, network architectures, heterogeneous hardware or non-upgradeable vendor-controlled systems, not all of which are compatible.

successful deployment of an IoT system should include an integrated way to monitor and remotely manage internet-enabled devices.
The emphasis on security should not interfere with performance, interoperability, power/processing capabilities, scalability and availability. 
This can be done either by adopting standard protocols or using services offered by a vendor for device management purposes.

Device Management
  registration, authentication, authorization, configuration, provisioning, monitoring, diagnostics, troubleshooting

Device Security
  Strong passwords, authentication, authorization, identity management, network segmentation, encryption, cryptography

Hardening the Devices
  patch/update devices to the most recent fix
  remove unneeded services/applications
  close any ports that dont need to be open
  make the device hard to find ( can't look up on shodan )
